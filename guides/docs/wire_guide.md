# Wire guide

Stringman's custom wires are described in [`guides/docs/wires/wires.yml`](wires/wires.yml) in this repository.

If creating them from scratch, you would need a connector kit and a crimping tool. However using a crimping tool can be really error prone without practice, and certain wires in this set could be made with the help of [pre-crimped wire tails](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807689754798.html)
