# Wire guide

Stringman (Pilot Launch) Contains several custom made wiring harnesses that are shipped in the hardware kit. they are described in `docs/wires/wires.yml` in this repository.

If creating them from scratch, you would need a dupont 2.54mm connector kit and a crimping tool. However using a crimping tool can be really error prone without practice, and certain wires in this set could be made with the help of [pre-crimped wire tails](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807689754798.html)
