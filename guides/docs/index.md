## Installing an Assembled Stringman

If you have [purchased a Stringman robot](https://neufangled.com/stringman-arpeggio-pilot) from Neufangled Robotics, and are ready to install it,

 * Start with the [Desktop Setup Guide](desktop_setup_guide.md) to make sure you can run the software before you hang anything.
 * Followed by the [Installation Guide](installation_guide.md) to put mount the anchors on the wall and hang the robot.
 * And finally the [Usage Guide](usage_guide.md) for a walkthough of your first use of Stringman.

## Building a Stringman Robot

#### Newest Design

 * The newest hardware version of the anchors is the Pilot version (1). Follow the [Anchor Build Guide](anchor_build_guide) for assembly.
 * The newest hardware version of the gripper is the Arpeggio version (2). Follow thge [Arpeggio Gripper Build Guide](arpeggio_gripper_build_guide.md)

#### Earlier versions

### STL files and BOM

## Safety and Legal

This is a prototype, it won't always work. Sometimes when moving fast the nema 17 motors in pilot version anchors will miss steps, and the gripper will swing down suddenly, before reeling itself back up. We are doing everything we can to prevent this in the next anchor hardware revision. But for now, please be aware of this risk and always keep the kill switch at hand.

*The user assumes full responsibility for any injury, damage, or loss resulting from the installation or use of the hardware.*
