Guides and downloads for the Stringman robot
[Software](https://github.com/nhnifong/cranebot3-firmware)

## Editing this documentation

### Setup

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    mkdocs serve

### Wireviz

Wire documentation is edited in `docs/wires/wires.yml`

When running locally it can be regenerated by first installing

    sudo apt-get install graphviz

And regenerating the wires.png image with

    wireviz docs/wires/wires.yml

When pushing to github, the ci will run that automatically.

### Serving from vite in development

build the docs directly into vite's public folder.

    mkdocs build -d ../nf-viz/public/docs

Hot reloading doesn't work in development with vite or from the docker container.
just use mkdocs serve for that.
